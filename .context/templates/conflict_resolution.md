# Conflict Resolution Protocol

This document outlines the formal process for detecting, escalating, and resolving conflicts in Memory Bank updates and agent activities within the Multi-Agent Memory System.

## Conflict Types and Severity Levels

### Conflict Types

1. **Content Conflicts**: Contradictory information in Memory Bank files
2. **Ownership Conflicts**: Disputes over file ownership or modification rights
3. **Priority Conflicts**: Disagreements about task priorities or resource allocation
4. **Implementation Conflicts**: Different approaches to implementing a solution
5. **Decision Conflicts**: Disagreements about technical or product decisions

### Severity Levels

1. **Low**: Minimal impact, can be resolved directly between agents
   - Examples: Minor documentation inconsistencies, formatting preferences
   
2. **Medium**: Moderate impact, requires team lead mediation
   - Examples: Implementation approach differences, secondary responsibility overlaps
   
3. **High**: Significant impact, requires orchestrator resolution
   - Examples: Major architectural disagreements, primary responsibility disputes

## Escalation Matrix

| Conflict Type | Low Severity | Medium Severity | High Severity |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Content | Direct Resolution | Team Lead Mediation | Orchestrator Resolution |
| Ownership | Direct Resolution | Team Lead Mediation | Orchestrator Resolution |
| Priority | Team Lead Mediation | Orchestrator Resolution | Stakeholder Involvement |
| Implementation | Direct Resolution | Team Lead Mediation | Orchestrator Resolution |
| Decision | Team Lead Mediation | Orchestrator Resolution | Stakeholder Involvement |

## Resolution Workflows

### Direct Resolution Process

1. Conflict is identified by an agent
2. Initiating agent contacts the other agent directly
3. Both agents discuss the conflict in a direct communication channel
4. Agents agree on a resolution approach
5. Resolution is documented in the appropriate Memory Bank file
6. Both agents confirm the resolution

### Team Lead Mediation Process

1. Conflict is escalated to the relevant team lead
2. Team lead reviews the conflict details
3. Team lead facilitates a discussion between involved agents
4. Team lead proposes a resolution approach
5. Resolution is documented in the appropriate Memory Bank file
6. All involved parties confirm the resolution

### Orchestrator Resolution Process

1. Conflict is escalated to the Orchestrator Agent
2. Orchestrator reviews the conflict details and previous resolution attempts
3. Orchestrator consults with relevant team leads
4. Orchestrator facilitates a resolution meeting
5. Orchestrator makes a final decision if consensus cannot be reached
6. Resolution is documented in the appropriate Memory Bank file
7. All involved parties acknowledge the resolution

## Conflict Prevention Best Practices

1. **Clear Ownership Boundaries**
   - Respect primary and secondary ownership as defined in the Role Registry
   - Consult with file owners before making significant changes

2. **Proactive Communication**
   - Announce intentions to modify shared resources in advance
   - Use structured message formats in communication channels

3. **Regular Synchronization**
   - Participate in regular sync meetings
   - Review recent changes to Memory Bank files

4. **Versioning Discipline**
   - Always update version headers when modifying files
   - Include detailed changelog entries

5. **Cross-Reference Validation**
   - Validate cross-references when updating files
   - Run validation tools to check for inconsistencies

## Monitoring and Improvement

The conflict resolution process will be regularly reviewed and improved based on:

1. Frequency of conflicts by type and severity
2. Resolution time metrics
3. Agent satisfaction with resolutions
4. Recurring conflict patterns

The Orchestrator Agent is responsible for maintaining this protocol and suggesting improvements based on system performance.
