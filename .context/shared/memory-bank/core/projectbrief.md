# Project Brief: Multi-Agent System for Context Maintenance

## Project Overview
The Multi-Agent System for Context Maintenance (MASCM) is a framework designed to enable multiple AI agents to collaborate effectively on software development projects by maintaining shared context and continuity of information across sessions.

## Core Requirements

1. **Persistent Memory**
   - Maintain comprehensive project documentation
   - Handle context resets between sessions
   - Ensure continuity of knowledge

2. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
   - Enable specialized agents to work together
   - Define clear roles and responsibilities
   - Facilitate effective communication

3. **Code-Context Alignment**
   - Maintain explicit mapping between documentation and code
   - Track evolution of implementation decisions
   - Ensure traceability from requirements to implementation

4. **Structured Documentation**
   - Hierarchical organization of project knowledge
   - Clear ownership of documentation components
   - Standardized update protocols

## Target Audience
- Development teams using AI assistants
- Software architects managing complex systems
- Product managers coordinating multiple workstreams

## Success Criteria
- Seamless knowledge transfer between agent sessions
- Reduced context loss during development
- Improved collaboration between specialized agents
- Clear traceability between requirements and implementation
- Consistent documentation quality and coverage

## Project Scope
