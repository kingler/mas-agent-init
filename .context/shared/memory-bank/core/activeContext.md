# Active Context

This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps for the Multi-Agent Memory System project. It serves as a central reference point for all agents to understand the current state of the project.

## Current Sprint Focus

**Sprint 3: Memory Bank Core Implementation**
*March 18 - March 31, 2025*

Our current focus is implementing the core Memory Bank structure and establishing the multi-agent collaboration protocols. This includes:

1. Setting up the Memory Bank directory structure
2. Creating core documentation files
3. Implementing agent-specific rules
4. Establishing communication protocols
5. Developing the context reset protocol

## Recent Changes

### Architecture
- Decided on hierarchical directory structure for Memory Bank
- Added codeContext.md to explicitly map code-documentation relationships
- Established primary ownership of Memory Bank files by agent role
- Defined structured communication protocols in agent_chat.md

### Implementation
- Created initial Memory Bank core files
- Implemented agent-specific rules with BDI framework
- Developed initialization script for system setup
- Established agent workspaces

### Process
- Defined Memory Bank update protocol
- Created context reset protocol with 5 phases
- Established structured communication formats
- Documented project intelligence in .clinerules

## Active Decisions

### Under Consideration
- **Documentation Versioning**: How to track changes to Memory Bank files over time
  - Options: Git integration, version headers, changelog files
  - Decision needed by: March 25, 2025
  - Owner: @agent1

- **Context Validation**: Automated methods to validate context consistency
  - Options: Cross-reference checking, schema validation, manual review
  - Decision needed by: March 28, 2025
  - Owner: @agent4

### Recently Decided
- **Memory Bank Structure**: Hierarchical directory structure
  - Decision date: March 18, 2025
  - Rationale: Better reflects conceptual model, improves navigation
  - Implementation owner: @agent2

- **Code-Context Mapping**: Added codeContext.md to Memory Bank
  - Decision date: March 18, 2025
  - Rationale: Improves code-documentation alignment
  - Implementation owner: @agent2

## Current Assignments

### Agent 1 (System Architect)
- Complete systemPatterns.md documentation
- Finalize techContext.md with technology stack details
- Review codeContext.md for architecture alignment
- Propose documentation versioning approach

### Agent 2 (Development Agent)
- Implement Memory Bank core structure
- Develop initialization script
- Maintain codeContext.md
- Create agent workspace structure

### Agent 3 (UX Agent)
- Develop productContext.md
- Create documentation templates
- Design user interaction flows
- Ensure documentation clarity and usability

### Agent 4 (Orchestrator)
- Maintain projectbrief.md and activeContext.md
- Coordinate cross-agent activities
- Track decisions and action items
- Develop context validation approach

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 3 Days)
1. Complete all Memory Bank core files
2. Finalize agent-specific rules
3. Test initialization script
4. Document communication protocols

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Implement context reset protocol
2. Develop documentation templates
3. Create example workflows
4. Test multi-agent collaboration

### Medium-Term (Next Month)
1. Implement documentation versioning
2. Develop context validation tools
3. Create training materials
4. Conduct system testing

## Open Questions

1. How should we handle conflicts when multiple agents need to update the same Memory Bank file?
2. What metrics should we use to evaluate the effectiveness of the Memory Bank?
3. How can we optimize the context reset protocol for efficiency?
4. What additional Memory Bank files might be needed for specific project types?
