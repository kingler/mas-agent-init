# Multi-Agent Context Sharing Memory System: Cursor Tab Agents

A starter framework for building multi-agent systems using Cursor's native features. This system enables multiple AI agents to collaborate effectively by maintaining shared context and continuity of information across sessions.

## Overview

The Multi-Agent Memory System (MAMS) leverages Cursor's Chat Tabs and Custom Modes to create a powerful collaboration framework with:

1. **Specialized Agent Roles** - Four specialized agents working in dedicated tabs
2. **Memory Bank System** - Structured documentation for shared context
3. **Cursor Rules Integration** - Role-specific behavior based on file patterns
4. **Orchestrator Computer Control** - Workflow automation across agents

This approach provides superior code-based context maintenance for LLMs through:
- Structured, hierarchical documentation
- Explicit code-context mapping
- Role-based specialization
- Clear communication protocols
- Comprehensive context reset handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) (latest version)
- Understand the Cursor Chat Tabs (⌘T) and Custom Modes features

### Initialization Process

There are multiple ways to initialize the multi-agent system:

#### Option 1: Simple Initialization (Recommended)

1. Clone this repository to start a new multi-agent project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mas-agent-init.git your-project-name
cd your-project-name
```

2. Run the convenience script:

```bash
node init-agents.js
# On Unix/Linux/macOS with execute permissions:
# ./init-agents.js
```

This is the simplest way to start the initialization process.

#### Option 2: Direct Initialization

If you prefer to run the initialization script directly:

```bash
node .cursor/agent-system/scripts/init_agents.js
```

This script will:
- Ask if this is a new project or existing one
- For new projects: Create project directory and structure
- For existing projects: Set up multi-agent system in current directory
- Launch Cursor with the appropriate configuration
- Guide you through the initial setup

#### Option 3: Clean Project Setup

If you prefer to have a project with minimal files in the root directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mas-agent-init.git
cd mas-agent-init
node .cursor/agent-system/scripts/setup.js
```

The setup script will:
- Create a new project directory
- Copy only the necessary files (.cursor directory and template)
- Create a minimal project_description.md file
- Add a simple init script (not package.json)
- Keep all agent system files within the .cursor directory

This gives you a clean project structure with only essential files in the root directory.

#### Option 4: Manual Initialization

1. Clone this repository or open your existing project in Cursor:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mas-agent-init.git your-project-name
cd your-project-name
```

2. Open the project in Cursor and set up your agent tabs:
   - Press ⌘T (or Ctrl+T on Windows/Linux) to create a new tab
   - Select "Orchestrator (Agent 4)" from the custom modes dropdown
   - Enter the command "start mas-agents" to trigger initialization
   - The Orchestrator will use computer control to create tabs for other agents
   - Follow the Orchestrator's instructions to complete the setup

#### Option 5: Quick Start for Experienced Users

If you're familiar with the system, you can manually create the agent tabs:

1. Open the project in Cursor
2. Press ⌘T to create a tab for Orchestrator (Agent 4)
3. Press ⌘T to create a tab for System Architect (Agent 1)
4. Press ⌘T to create a tab for Development Agent (Agent 2)
5. Press ⌘T to create a tab for UX Agent (Agent 3)
6. Use the Orchestrator to initialize the Memory Bank structure
7. Begin development with the multi-agent system

### Project Description

For all initialization methods, you'll need a project description. You have three options:

1. **Manual Creation**: Complete the `project_description.md` file using the template structure.

2. **Orchestrator-Assisted**: Start with a minimal description and let the Orchestrator help you complete it through an interactive interview process:
   - The Orchestrator will ask you key questions about your project
   - Based on your answers, it will generate a comprehensive description
   - You can review and approve the generated description

3. **Template Reference**: Use the included `project_description_template.md` as a reference for the recommended structure and details to include.

A good project description should include:
- Project goals and objectives
- Key features and functionality
- Technical requirements and preferences
- User experience considerations
- Any specific constraints or preferences

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflow

The Multi-Agent Memory System follows a human-in-the-loop workflow:

1. **Project Description Approval**
   - After initialization, the system generates a detailed project brief based on your description
   - You review and approve the project brief or request changes
   - Once approved, the multi-agent system begins work

2. **Milestone Approvals**
   - The system works autonomously, with agents collaborating through the Memory Bank
   - You are only consulted for milestone approvals
   - Agents handle all implementation details without requiring human intervention for tasks

3. **Progress Monitoring**
   - You can monitor progress through the Memory Bank files
   - The `progress.md` file provides an overview of completed work and next steps
   - The `activeContext.md` file shows the current focus of the system

## System Structure

The Multi-Agent System uses a clean, consolidated file structure to minimize clutter in your project's root directory:

```
project-root/               # Your project's root directory
├── project_description.md  # The only project-specific file in root
├── project_description_template.md  # Template for project descriptions

│       ├── templates/     # Documentation templates
│       └── scripts/       # Initialization scripts
```

This structure keeps your project organized with:
1. Only project-specific files in the root directory
2. All agent system files consolidated under `.cursor/agent-system/`
3. Standard Cursor configuration in the `.cursor/` directory
4. Clear separation between project code and agent infrastructure

## Core Components

### Memory Bank

The Memory Bank is a hierarchical documentation structure that serves as the central source of truth for the project:

1. **projectbrief.md** - Foundation document defining core requirements and goals
2. **productContext.md** - Why the project exists and how it should work
3. **activeContext.md** - Current work focus, recent changes, and next steps
4. **systemPatterns.md** - System architecture and key technical decisions
5. **techContext.md** - Technologies used and technical constraints
6. **progress.md** - Implementation status and known issues
7. **codeContext.md** - Explicit mapping between code and documentation

### Agent Roles

Each agent has specific responsibilities within the system:

1. **System Architect (Agent 1)** - Architecture and technical design specialist
   - Focus on system patterns and technical documentation
   - Primary owner of systemPatterns.md and techContext.md
   - Creates technical diagrams and documents architecture decisions

2. **Development Agent (Agent 2)** - Implementation specialist 
   - Focus on code quality, testing, and code-context mapping
   - Primary owner of codeContext.md
   - Implements features based on architectural decisions

3. **UX Agent (Agent 3)** - User experience specialist
   - Focus on interface design, usability, and product context
   - Primary owner of productContext.md
   - Creates user interfaces and documents user flows

4. **Orchestrator (Agent 4)** - Project coordinator and system controller
   - Focus on project management and team coordination
   - Primary owner of activeContext.md, progress.md, and projectbrief.md
   - Exclusive access to computer use capabilities for workflow automation

## Cursor Integration

The Multi-Agent Memory System fully integrates with Cursor's Chat Tabs and Custom Modes features for an enhanced multi-agent experience.

### Chat Tabs for Agent Separation

Each agent operates in its own dedicated tab, allowing for:
- Parallel agent conversations
- Independent context preservation
- Visual indication of awaiting input (orange dot)
- Clear separation of agent responsibilities

To create a new agent tab:
1. Press `⌘T` (or `Ctrl+T` on Windows/Linux)
2. Select the appropriate agent custom mode
3. Name the tab according to the agent role

### Custom Modes for Agent Roles

Four custom modes are configured for each agent role:

1. **System Architect (Agent 1)** - `Alt+1`
   - Architecture and technical design specialist
   - Focus on system patterns and technical documentation
   
2. **Development Agent (Agent 2)** - `Alt+2`
   - Implementation specialist
   - Focus on code quality, testing, and code-context mapping
   
3. **UX Agent (Agent 3)** - `Alt+3`
   - User experience specialist
   - Focus on interface design, usability, and product context
   
4. **Orchestrator (Agent 4)** - `Alt+4`
   - Project coordinator with exclusive computer use capabilities
   - Focus on project management and team coordination

### Cursor Rules Integration

The system leverages Cursor's Rules feature for role-specific behavior:

- File-specific rules automatically apply agent context
- Memory Bank protocols ensure consistent documentation
- Communication protocols standardize inter-agent messaging
- Computer use capabilities restricted to the Orchestrator

### Orchestrator as System Controller

The Orchestrator Agent (Agent 4) serves as the system controller with exclusive computer use capabilities:

1. **Computer Use Authority**
   - Only the Orchestrator can use `use_yourself.py` for computer interaction
   - Can approve other agents' suggestions by clicking UI elements
   - Can type instructions for other agents in their tabs
   - Can take screenshots to verify system state
   - Can navigate between components without human intervention

2. **Execution Flow**
   - Other agents make suggestions that require approval
   - Orchestrator reviews and approves changes
   - Orchestrator executes cross-agent workflows
   - Orchestrator documents all interactions in logs

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Uses the `use_yourself.py` script with explicit safety protocols
   - Follows strict formatting: `I am cursor, please instruct me to [task]`
   - Maintains 5-second safety delay for human verification
   - Uses screenshots for visual confirmation
   - Coordinates through the Memory Bank and agent chat

This design creates a secure, controlled environment where only the designated Orchestrator can perform actions that would normally require human intervention, enabling true automation across the multi-agent system while maintaining security boundaries.
