## Agent Implementation

- Each agent must implement the BaseAgent interface
- All agent inputs must be validated using Zod schemas
- Comprehensive error handling must be implemented for all operations
- Each agent must have corresponding test files that verify all functionality
- Mock implementations must follow the same interface as real implementations
- Document where real LLM implementations would differ from mocks

## Testing Standards

- Test files must verify all public methods of the agent
- Tests must cover both successful and error scenarios
- Mock all external dependencies for consistent test results
- Test input validation by providing invalid inputs
- Verify error handling by triggering error conditions
- Run tests after implementation to verify functionality before committing

## Implementation Guidelines

- Follow consistent naming conventions across all agents
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments for all public methods
- Implement proper type definitions for all inputs and outputs
- Ensure all async operations have proper error handling
- Avoid any hardcoded values that might change in different environments
