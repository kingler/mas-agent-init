## Pre-Commit Verification

- Run the full test suite before any merge to main
- Address all TypeScript/linting errors before committing
- Verify code compiles without warnings
- Run static analysis tools to catch potential issues
- Document any known limitations or TODOs

## Code Review Process

- Verify test coverage for new functionality
- Ensure error handling is properly implemented for all edge cases
- Check that input validation is comprehensive
- Review test cases to confirm they test actual requirements
- Verify that tests cover both happy path and error scenarios
