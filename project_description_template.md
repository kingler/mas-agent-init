...
```

## Key Features and Functionality

Describe the main features and functionality that your project should include.

```
1. [Feature 1]: [Brief description]

- [Language/Framework 2]: [Reason for choice, if applicable]
...
```

### Architecture Preferences

```
[Describe any architectural preferences or requirements, e.g., microservices, monolith, serverless, etc.]
```

[Specify any time, budget, or resource constraints]
[Mention any technical limitations or challenges]
```

## Success Criteria

Define how success will be measured for this project.

```
[List specific, measurable criteria that will determine if the project is successful]

## Tips for Writing Effective Project Descriptions

1. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete details rather than vague descriptions.
2. **Use Examples**: When possible, include examples to illustrate your requirements.
3. **Prioritize**: Indicate which features or requirements are most important.
4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Mention any special cases or exceptions that should be handled.
5. **Avoid Jargon**: Unless it's industry-standard terminology, explain any specialized terms.
6. **Focus on What, Not How**: Describe what you want to achieve, not how to implement it (unless you have specific implementation requirements).
7. **Include References**: If applicable, reference existing systems or products that are similar to what you want.

Remember, the AI agents will use this description to generate the initial project structure and plan the implementation. The more information you provide, the better the results will be.
